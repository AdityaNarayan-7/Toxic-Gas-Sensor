Project Outline
Type: Concept Educational Design


Purpose: This concept design is used for learning how to interface Arduino with safety measures in order to protect living organisms.


Objective: To develop Harmful Gas Detector for the purpose of human safety 


Platforms used: Arduino Uno R4, Arduino IDE, MQ-2 gas sensor, KiCAD


Timeline: 14 Days


Budget: 100 - 150 dollars if full kit is bought or 50 - 75 for just necessary materials.


Possible extension: Integrate within actual pipes for testing, possibly hook up multiple sensors, and connect to wifi to upload to cloud data. Expand to possible air quality sensors as well to provide constant updated air quality data.
